# AFK Protective Kick

This mod kicks players who are idling and are in danger, preventing them from unnoticed death.

Currently, the following are checked:

1. Nodes dealing constant damage to players (e.g. Lava)
2. Nodes that drown players (e.g. Water)
3. Starving, if [`hbhunger`](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/hbhunger/) is installed.
